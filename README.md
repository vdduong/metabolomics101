####
The initial package contains 2 coding files and 1 database extracted from BMRB.
In order to run the algorithm, you'll have to make a few changes in the core code :
- in functions.py, in 'def data_file() :', we need to modify the link access to the database
- in running_file.py, in the line name_file_spectrum, we need to modify the link access to your experimental 
peak list (the peak-list format is the one from ATNOS output).

If it doesn't work after all the changes, welcome to programming 101 : 5 minutes of coding, 4 hours of debugging.
I'll be available for any question and any bug.
